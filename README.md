Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dhi, and this repository is a collection of my personal learning journey in programming. As a beginner, I want to track my progress and share the lessons I've learned along the way. This repository will cover everything from basic concepts to more advanced topics as I continue to grow and develop my skills.

The purpose of this repository is to:

    Document my learning process as I explore various programming languages and technologies.
    Keep track of projects, code snippets, and solutions to exercises.
    Share my learning experience with others who may also be starting out in programming.
